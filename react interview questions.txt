1. What is React?
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly focused on single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components as data changes.

2. What are components in React?
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either class components (using ES6 classes) or functional components (using functions) and allow for code reusability and separation of concerns.

3. What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML and is used with React to describe UI elements. JSX makes the code easier to read and write by directly embedding HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.

4. What are props in React?
Props (short for "properties") are inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the receiving component.

5. What is the difference between state and props?
Props are read-only and passed from parent to child, allowing for data sharing between components.
State is a local, mutable data store for each component and is managed within the component itself.
6. Explain the useState Hook.
useState is a React Hook that allows functional components to manage state. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.

javascript
Copy code
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
7. What is the useEffect Hook?
useEffect is a React Hook used to handle side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or modifying the DOM. It runs after the render and can be configured to re-run based on dependencies.

javascript
Copy code
useEffect(() => {
  // side effect logic here
}, [dependencies]);
8. What is a key in React, and why is it important?
Keys are unique identifiers for list items that help React identify which items have changed, are added, or removed. This improves rendering performance and ensures correct component updates.

9. Explain controlled vs. uncontrolled components.
Controlled Components have their state managed by React (e.g., form inputs tied to state).
Uncontrolled Components manage their state using the DOM, often accessed via refs.
10. What is the virtual DOM?
The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM used by React to optimize performance. React updates the virtual DOM first, calculates the minimal changes needed, and then updates the actual DOM accordingly.

11. What is the Context API?
The Context API allows for passing data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level, which is useful for global data like themes or user authentication.

12. Explain the React lifecycle methods.
React lifecycle methods are functions that allow components to hook into different stages of their lifecycle:

Mounting: constructor, componentDidMount
Updating: shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate
Unmounting: componentWillUnmount
13. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?
A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality. HOCs are used for reusability and extending functionality.

14. What is the difference between functional and class components?
Functional Components are simpler, often preferred, and support React Hooks.
Class Components are ES6 classes that support lifecycle methods but are generally more complex and now less commonly used in favor of Hooks.
15. What is React Router?
React Router is a library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different views or pages by manipulating the URL without reloading the page.

16. Explain the useRef Hook.
useRef is a React Hook that creates a mutable reference object. It's commonly used to access or store a DOM element or persist a value across renders without triggering re-renders.

17. What is a Pure Component?
A Pure Component is a class component that implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow prop and state comparison to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

18. Explain lazy loading in React.
Lazy loading is the practice of loading components or resources as they are needed, which can improve performance. React's React.lazy and Suspense are commonly used for lazy loading components.

19. What is React.memo?
React.memo is a higher-order component that prevents functional components from re-rendering if their props haven't changed, improving performance.

20. What are fragments in React?
Fragments allow grouping multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. This is useful for avoiding unnecessary wrapping elements.

javascript
Copy code
<>
  <p>Fragment example</p>
  <p>Another element</p>
</>
21. What is PropTypes?
PropTypes is a library for type-checking React props. It helps catch type errors by validating prop types, especially in larger applications.

22. What is the purpose of React.StrictMode?
React.StrictMode is a wrapper component that helps identify potential problems by running additional checks, like detecting unsafe lifecycle methods or highlighting legacy code.

23. Explain reconciliation in React.
Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the real DOM. React compares the current and previous virtual DOMs, applies minimal changes, and efficiently updates the real DOM.

24. What is an error boundary?
An error boundary is a component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components' subtree, logs the error, and displays a fallback UI without crashing the entire app.

25. What are portals in React?
Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node outside the parent component's DOM hierarchy. They're useful for elements like modals or tooltips.

26. Explain the useCallback Hook.
useCallback memoizes a function, only recreating it when its dependencies change. It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially when passing functions as props.

27. What is the useMemo Hook?
useMemo is used to memoize a calculated value, optimizing performance by preventing expensive calculations on every render unless dependencies change.

28. What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?
useEffect runs after the render, suitable for async data or side effects.
useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after layout calculations, ideal for measuring the DOM before render.
29. What is Suspense in React?
Suspense allows components to delay rendering until dependencies (like data or lazy-loaded components) are ready.

30. What are controlled components in forms?
Controlled components are form elements like <input> where the state is managed by React. The value of the element is tied to component state, ensuring control over the form data.

31. Explain the useReducer Hook.
useReducer is a Hook for managing more complex state logic. It uses a reducer function to update state, similar to Redux, and is suitable for managing state transitions.

32. What is the purpose of shouldComponentUpdate?
shouldComponentUpdate is a lifecycle method used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when props or state haven't changed.

33. What is the purpose of componentDidCatch?
componentDidCatch is a lifecycle method for handling errors in component children, allowing for error handling in error boundaries.

34. What is Flux in React?
Flux is an architecture pattern that enforces unidirectional data flow, with components reacting to data from a central store, commonly associated with state management in React.

35. Explain React's one-way data flow.
React's one-way data flow ensures that data flows in a single direction, from parent to child components, promoting predictable and easier-to-debug code.

36. What is Redux?
Redux is a state management library for managing application state in a predictable way. It uses a single store, actions, and reducers to update the state.

37. What are the main Redux components?
Store: Holds the application state.
Actions: Plain objects representing events to change state.
Reducers: Functions that take the current state and an action and return a new state.
38. Explain the connect function in Redux.
connect is a higher-order function that connects React components to the Redux store, allowing components to access the state and dispatch actions.

39. What is middleware in Redux?
Middleware in Redux intercepts actions before they reach the reducer, allowing for additional processing (e.g., async logic with redux-thunk).

40. What is a thunk?
A thunk is a middleware that allows for delayed action dispatching in Redux, enabling async actions.

41. What is server-side rendering (SSR)?
Server-side rendering is the process of rendering a React component on the server instead of the client. It improves SEO and initial load performance by serving fully-rendered HTML.
